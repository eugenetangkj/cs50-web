# CS50: Web Programming with Python and Javascript
## About
This repository contains my project work for the course CS50: Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
### Project 0 (Preliminary)
In Week 0: HTML and CSS, the lesson introduced Bootstrap, which I found interesting. Therefore, I created a simple website via Bootstrap to explore more of the framework before embarking on Project 0. While it is created using Bootstrap, I customised certain parts of the CSS using my prior knowledge. The content and design of the website is simplistic as it is meant as an introductory project for me to learn about the basics of Bootstrap and explore some of its features.
