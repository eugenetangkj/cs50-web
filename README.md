# CS50: Web Programming with Python and Javascript
## About
This repository contains my project work for the course CS50: Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
### Preliminary Project
In Week 0: HTML and CSS, the lesson introduced Bootstrap, which I found interesting. Therefore, I created a simple website via Bootstrap to explore more of the framework before embarking on Project 0. While it is created using Bootstrap, I customised certain parts of the CSS using my prior knowledge. The content and design of the website is simplistic as it is meant as an introductory project for me to learn about the basics of Bootstrap and explore some of its features.

### Project 0
The task was to create Google Search, Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search pages using HTML and CSS. I implemented the sites with the help of Bootstrap and deduced the correct GET requests to be made via inspection of the URLs of Google searches and utilisation of the Network inspector of the browser.
